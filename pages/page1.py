        This project aims to predict the **PM2.5 concentration** in Beijing from 2013 to 2017 using advanced machine learning techniques. 
        Understanding PM2.5 levels is crucial for environmental planning and improving air quality.

        ## üìä Dataset Information
        - **Source**: Beijing Environmental Monitoring Center
        - **Time Period**: March 1, 2013, to February 28, 2017
        - **Features**: 
            - Air pollutant levels (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3)
            - Meteorological data (Temperature, Pressure, Wind Speed, Rainfall)
        - **Sites**: Data from **12 monitoring stations** across Beijing.
        
        Missing values in the dataset are denoted as `NA` and have been handled appropriately during preprocessing.
