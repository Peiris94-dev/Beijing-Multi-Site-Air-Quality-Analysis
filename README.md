# Beijing Air Quality Analysis and Prediction

## ðŸŒŸ Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting air quality in Beijing using machine learning models and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset contains hourly air pollution data from 12 monitoring sites in Beijing, covering the period from March 1, 2013, to February 28, 2017.

Key features of this project include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing values and data preprocessing
- Building machine learning models for prediction
- Interactive Streamlit application for data visualization and model interaction
